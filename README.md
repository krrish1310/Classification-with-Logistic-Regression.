# Task 4: Binary Classification with Logistic Regression

## 📌 Objective
Build a binary classifier using logistic regression on a given dataset using Python and Scikit-learn.

## 📁 Dataset
We used the provided `data.csv` for binary classification.

## 📈 Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas.
2. Preprocessed the data and split it into training and testing sets.
3. Standardized the features using `StandardScaler`.
4. Trained a logistic regression model using `LogisticRegression`.
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
   - ROC-AUC score
   - ROC Curve Plot
6. Explained the sigmoid function and demonstrated it with a plot.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Anaconda Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`

## ✅ Outcome
Successfully implemented a logistic regression model for binary classification and evaluated its performance using standard metrics.
